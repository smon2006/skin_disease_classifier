# Skin Disease Detection using EfficientNet-B0

A Deep Learning project using **PyTorch** and **Transfer Learning** to detect 22 different types of skin conditions. This model utilizes the **EfficientNet-B0** architecture, fine-tuned with advanced techniques like Test-Time Augmentation (TTA), Label Smoothing, and Cosine Annealing.

## Performance Summary
* **Top-1 Accuracy:** 74.90%
* **Top-5 Accuracy:** 95.80%
* **Best F1-Score:** 0.96 (Unknown_Normal) & 0.91 (Vitiligo)

## Tech Stack & Methods
- **Framework:** PyTorch
- **Base Model:** `EfficientNet_B0` (Pre-trained on ImageNet)
- **Optimizer:** `AdamW` with differential learning rates (features: `1e-7`, classifier: `1e-6`)
- **Scheduler:** `CosineAnnealingLR`
- **Loss Function:** `CrossEntropyLoss` with **Label Smoothing (0.1)** and **Class Weights** to handle dataset imbalance.
- **Augmentations:** Random Horizontal/Vertical Flips, ColorJitter, Random Rotation, and Random Cropping.

## Dataset
The model was trained on the [Skin Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pacificrm/skindiseasedataset) from Kaggle, containing 13,898 training images and 1,546 test images across 22 classes:

| Index | Class Name | Index | Class Name |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Acne | 11 | Psoriasis |
| 1 | Actinic Keratosis | 12 | Rosacea |
| 2 | Benign Tumors | 13 | Seborrh_Keratoses |
| 3 | Bullous | 14 | Skin Cancer |
| 4 | Candidiasis | 15 | Sun Sunlight Damage |
| 5 | Drug Eruption | 16 | Tinea |
| 6 | Eczema | 17 | Unknown Normal |
| 7 | Infestations Bites | 18 | Vascular Tumors |
| 8 | Lichen | 19 | Vasculitis |
| 9 | Lupus | 20 | Vitiligo |
| 10| Moles | 21 | Warts |

## How to Use

### 1. Prerequisites
```bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn pillow
```

### 2. Run Inference
You can use the `predict_real_image` function provided in the source code to run Top-3 predictions on any local image:

```python
# Example usage
predict_real_image(model=my_model, 
                   image_path="path_to_your_image.jpg", 
                   class_names=class_names)
```
